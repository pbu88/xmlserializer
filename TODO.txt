TODO:

- Add capability to handle different encodings (like utf-8)
- Include more built-in types (like `array` for example)
- Need to write tests for `unicode` data type serialization
- Think a way to generalize it to be used as a Mixin and as a normal
  Python object to serialize stuff
- Extend this TODO :)
